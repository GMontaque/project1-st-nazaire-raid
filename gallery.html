              For great gallantry in the attack on St. Nazaire. He commanded a
              force of small unprotected ships in an attack on a heavily
              defended port and led H.M.S. Campbeltown in under intense fire
              from short range weapons at point blank range. Though the main
              object of the expedition had been accomplished in the beaching of
              Campbeltown, he remained on the spot conducting operations,
              evacuating men from Campbeltown and dealing with strong points and
              close range weapons while exposed to heavy fire for one hour and
              sixteen minutes, and did not withdraw till it was certain that his
              ship could be of no use in rescuing any of the Commando Troops who
              were still ashore. That his Motor Gun Boat, now full of dead and
              wounded, should have survived and should have been able to
              withdraw through an intense barrage of close range fire was almost
              a miracle

            <h3>Augustus Charles NEWMAN</h3>
            <blockquote>
              On the night of 27th/28th March, 1942, Lieutenant-Colonel Newman
              was in command of the military force detailed to land on enemy
              occupied territory and destroy the dock installations of the
              German controlled naval base at St Nazaire. This important base
              was known to be heavily defended and bomber support had to be
              abandoned owing to bad weather. The operation was therefore bound
              to be exceedingly hazardous, but Lieutenant-Colonel Newman,
              although empowered to call off the assault at any stage, was
              determined to carry to a successful conclusion the important task
              which had been assigned to him. Coolly and calmly he stood on the
              bridge of the leading craft, as the small force steamed up the
              estuary of the River Loire, although the ships had been caught in
              the enemy searchlights and a murderous crossfire opened from both
              banks, causing heavy casualties. Although Lieutenant-Colonel
              Newman need not have landed himself, he was one of the first
              ashore and, during the next five hours of bitter fighting, he
              personally entered several houses and shot up the occupants and
              supervised the operations in the town, utterly regardless of his
              own safety, and he never wavered in his resolution to carry
              through the operation upon which so much depended. An enemy gun
              position on the roof of a U-boat pen had been causing heavy
              casualties to the landing craft and Lieutenant-Colonel Newman
              directed the fire of a mortar against this position to such effect
              that the gun was silenced. Still fully exposed, he then brought
              machine gun fire to bear on an armed trawler in the harbour,
              compelling it to withdraw and thus preventing many casualties in
              the main demolition area. Under the brilliant leadership of this
              officer the troops fought magnificently and held vastly superior
              enemy forces at bay, until the demolition parties had successfully
              completed their work of destruction. By this time, however, most
              of the landing craft had been sunk or set on fire and evacuation
              by sea was no longer possible. Although the main objective had
              been achieved, Lieutenant- Colonel Newman nevertheless was now
              determined to try and fight his way out into open country and so
              give all survivors a chance to escape. The only way out of the
              harbour area lay across a narrow iron bridge covered by enemy
              machine guns and although severely shaken by a German hand
              grenade, which had burst at his feet, Lieutenant-Colonel Newman
              personally led the charge which stormed the position and under his
              inspiring leadership the small force fought its way through the
              streets to a point near the open country, when, all ammunition
              expended, he and his men were finally overpowered by the enemy.
              The outstanding gallantry and devotion to duty of this fearless
              officer, his brilliant leadership and initiative, were largely
              responsible for the success of this perilous operation which
              resulted in heavy damage to the important naval base at St.
              Nazaire

            <h3>Thomas Frank DURRANT</h3>
            <blockquote>
              For great gallantry, skill and devotion to duty when in charge of
              a Lewis gun in H.M. Motor Launch 306 in the St Nazaire raid on the
              28th March, 1942. Motor Launch 306 came under heavy fire while
              proceeding up the River Loire towards the port. Sergeant Durrant,
              in his position abaft the bridge, where he had no cover or
              protection, engaged enemy gun positions and searchlights on shore.
              During this engagement he was severely wounded in the arm but
              refused to leave his gun. The Motor Launch subsequently went down
              the river and was attacked by a German destroyer at 50-60 yards
              range, and often closer. In this action Sergeant Durrant continued
              to fire at the destroyer’s bridge with the greatest of coolness
              and with complete disregard of the enemy’s fire. The Motor Launch
              was illuminated by the enemy searchlight and Sergeant Durrant drew
              on himself the individual attention of the enemy guns, and was
              again wounded, in many places. Despite these further wounds he
              stayed in his exposed position, still firing his gun, although
              after a time only able to support himself by holding on to the gun
              mounting. After a running fight, the Commander of the German
              destroyer called on the Motor Launch to surrender. Sergeant
              Durrant’s answer was a further burst of fire at the destroyer’s
              bridge. Although now very weak he went on firing, using drums of
              ammunition as fast as they could be replaced. A renewed attack by
              the enemy vessel eventually silenced the fire of the Motor Launch
              but Sergeant Durrant refused to give up until the destroyer came
              alongside, grappled the Motor Launch and took prisoner those who
              remained alive. Sergeant Durrant’s gallant fight was commended by
              the German officers on boarding the Motor Launch. This very
              gallant Non-Commissioned Officer later died of the many wounds
              received in action.

              in command of H.M.S. Campbeltown. Under intense fire directed at
              the bridge from point blank range of about 100 yards, and in the
              face of the blinding glare of many searchlights, he steamed her
