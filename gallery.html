            in the St. Nazaire raid. Completely exposed, and under heavy fire he

            shown by many others, unnamed, in Motor Launches, Motor Gun Boats
            and Motor Torpedo Boats, who gallantly carried out their duty in

            with strong points and close range weapons while exposed to heavy

            was certain that his ship could be of no use in rescuing any of the

            March, 1942, Lieutenant-Colonel Newman was in command of the
            military force detailed to land on enemy occupied territory and
            destroy the dock installations of the German controlled naval base
            at St Nazaire. This important base was known to be heavily defended
            and bomber support had to be abandoned owing to bad weather. The
            operation was therefore bound to be exceedingly hazardous, but
            Lieutenant-Colonel Newman, although empowered to call off the
            assault at any stage, was determined to carry to a successful
            conclusion the important task which had been assigned to him. Coolly
            and calmly he stood on the bridge of the leading craft, as the small
            force steamed up the estuary of the River Loire, although the ships
            had been caught in the enemy searchlights and a murderous crossfire
            opened from both banks, causing heavy casualties.....<i

            wounded in the arm but refused to leave his gun. The Motor Launch
            subsequently went down the river and was attacked by a German
            destroyer at 50-60 yards range, and often closer. In this action
            Sergeant Durrant continued to fire at the destroyer’s bridge with
