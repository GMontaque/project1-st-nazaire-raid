            In the darkest months of the Second World War, Churchill approved
            what seemed to many like a suicide mission. Under orders to attack
            the St Nazaire U-boat base on the Atlantic seaboard, British
            commandos undertook "the greatest raid of all", turning an old
            destroyer into a live bomb and using it to ram the gates of a Nazi
            stronghold. Five Victoria Crosses were awarded -- more than in any
            similar operation. Drawing on official documents, interviews,
            unknown accounts and the astonished reactions of French civilians
            and German forces, The Greatest Raid recreates in cinematic detail
            the hours in which the "Charioteers" fought and died, from Lt Gerard
            Brett, the curator at the V & A, to "Bertie" Burtinshaw, who went
            into battle humming There'll Always be an England, and from Lt
            Stuart Chant, who set the fuses with 90 seconds to escape, to the
            epic solo reconnaissance of the legendary Times journalist Capt
            Micky Burn. Unearthing the untold human stories of Operation
            Chariot, Bridge of Spies author Giles Whittell reveals it to be a
            fundamentally misconceived raid whose impact and legacy was secured
            by astonishing bravery.

            It is the night of 28 March 1942. Royal Navy and British commandos
            are poised to assault the German-held port of Saint-Nazaire in what
            will be one of the most audacious and daring raids of the Second
            World War. The plan is simple: to drive an old destroyer, packed
            with three tons of explosive, at full speed into the outer gate of
            the Normandie dock. The aim is to destroy the base from which the
            formidable battleship Tirpitz would be able to devastate the convoys
            supplying Britain from the United States. 'Operation Chariot' was to
            be dramatically successful, but at a great cost. Fewer than half the
            men who went on the mission returned. In recognition of their
            valour, eighty-nine decorations were awarded, including five
            Victoria Crosses. Into the Jaws of Death is the true story of how
            the decisive courage of a small group of men changed the course of
            the war.
