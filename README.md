### Typography and color scheme

- for the font i have used (insert name)
  - i ahve used this font as i was looking for a style that would appear to be hand wriotten
  - i have also used this font as the main background of the site contains an image from a declassifed doucemnt about the raid, i was looking for a font style that match this style of text
  - i also wanted the text to almost look as if it was from that time period
- for the colours i ahve kept this to simple colours of grey black and white
  - these colours ahv been choosen due to the time period the website cover 1939-1945
  - during this period most images were black and white
  - also i wanted the colour scheme to follow the background which is taken from a declassifed document

### WIREFRAMES

#### HOME PAGE

![Home page made in wireframes](assets/images/St-Nazaire-mockup.png)

- the idea of the the homepage was to create something that had a large clear image at the top and within the few seconds the user should clearly be able to tell what the website is about
- the homepage was also to contain the content of the battle and break it down into a number of sections either 4 or 5 
- each section was to have both image and text to balance out the page

#### GALLERY PAGE

![gallery page made in wireframes](assets/images/St-Nazaire-mockup.png)
- this page was to be made up of 2 parts a gallery section and vc winners section
- the gallery section is to include all real images either from before or after the battle and aswell as images related to the battle
- the images would be responsive in desgin
- below or about that there would be a vc winners section, this would describe the person and provide comments about them

#### media PAGE

![media page made in wireframes](assets/images/St-Nazaire-mockup.png)
- this page included some more visual content as well as some offical videos and interviews
- the page is to comtain some embed content from other site to give people a more broad expericne
- the layout would be set to one or two videos coupled with some book recommendations

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
