# St Nazaire Raid - Operation Chariot

## About the Project

![picture of the mockup of the website](assets/images/mockup.PNG)

I have created a website where a user can view infomration about the St Nazaire Raid which is a battle that took place during WW2 but is not so well known or famous as some other battles such as D-day or the Battle of Berlin. I'd argue thought, that it should equally be placed up there with other famous battles and that what was done on that fateful day was something that people have said was considered to be not possible and a suicide mission.

Through the website, I aim to show a user how the plan initially got its routes and the reasons such a plan had to come together. Then I will explain to the user both the battle itself and the struggles and problems that were faced by the attacking force, before finally finishing by showing where a person can visit the war memorial for this battle.

There are also links to further documents and videos where a user can find further information and even some first-hand accounts of the men who took part in the battle.

![Signup Confirmation](assets/images/signup-confirm.PNG)
![Signup Confirmation Mobile](assets/images/signup-confirm-mobile.PNG)

### Typography and Colour Scheme

- For the font i have used Playpen Sans [google font link](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans)
  - I have used this font as I was looking for a style that would appear to be handwritten
  - I have also used this font as the main background of the site contains an image from a declassified document about the raid, i was looking for a font style that matches this style of text
  - I also wanted the text to look as if it was from that time period
- For the colours I have kept this to simple colours of dark slate grey, black and white
  - These colours have been chosen due to the time period the website covers 1939-1945
  - During this time period most images were black and white
  - I wanted the colour scheme to follow the background which is taken from a declassified document

### WIREFRAMES

#### HOME PAGE

- The idea of the the homepage was to create something that had a large clear image at the top and within a few seconds the user should be able to tell what the website is about
- The homepage was also to contain the content of the battle and break it down into several sections either 4 or 5
- Each section was to have both images and text to balance out the page

![homepage wireframe](assets/images/homepage-wireframe.PNG)

#### GALLERY PAGE

- This page was to be made up of 2 parts a gallery section and vc winners section
- The gallery section is to include real images either from before or after the battle as well as images related to the battle
- The images would be responsive in design
- Below or above that there would be a VC winners section, this would describe the VC winners and provide comments about them

![Gallery wireframe](assets/images/gallery-wireframe.PNG)

#### Media PAGE

- This page includes some more visual content as well as some offical videos and interviews
- The page is to contain some embedded content from other sites to give people a more broad experience
- The layout would be set to one or two videos coupled with some book recommendations
- The book recommendation section would also provide a link so the user can go on purchase the book if they so wish

![Media Page wireframe](assets/images/media-page-wireframe.PNG)

### Mobile Wireframe

- Here i have created the wireframe for how the website should look on mobile

![Mobile wireframe](assets/images/mobile-wireframe.PNG)

## Testing

- I have tested the website in different broswers such as google, firefox and Edge
- On each browser, I have gone into the dev tools and tested the website at different screen sizes, from mobile to full size. Examples below from Firefox and Edge:

![image test in edge](assets/images/edge-website-test.PNG)
![image test in firefox](assets/images/firefox-website-test.PNG)

- I have used lighthouse to test the website as per the image below:

![iamge showing page speed report pc result](assets/images/pagespeed-report-pc.PNG)
![iamge showing page speed report mobile  result](assets/images/pagespeed-report-mobile.PNG)

- Validation from homepage
  ![iamge showing homepage result](assets/images/lighthouse-indexpage.PNG)

- Validation for gallery page
  ![iamge showing gallery result](assets/images/lighthouse-gallerypage.PNG)

- Validation for media page
  ![iamge showing media result](assets/images/lighthouse-mediapage.PNG)

### Validator Testing

- I have tested all HTML pages on the HTML validator and there are no errors

  - Home Page
  - Gallery Page
  - Media Page

- When building the website I have used an extension called pritter which has resulted in the warnings that you can see on each screenshot below:

  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)

  ![html validator results](assets/images/html-validator.PNG)

- When testing my CSS as you can see from the below image there are no errors

  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)

![CSS validator results](assets/images/css-validator.PNG)

- When testing the website on different devices i have used the pre-defined dimensions that come with the developer tools on Google Chrome
- I have also researched several websites which have described the most common screen size for devices in 2023 for desktop and mobile - https://www.designrush.com/agency/web-development-companies/trends/website-dimensions

![Media Page wireframe](assets/images/most-common-screen-resolutions-worldwide-content.jpg)

**External Links**

- I have tested each external link to make sure that it goes to the correct website
- I have also tested the links to make sure that they all open the website on a new broswer tab

**Mobile Na0vbar Header**

- The navbar on mobile has been tested to make sure that it appears when the burger is clicked
- The navbar has been testing to make sure that the large screen navbar disappears and only the mobile version is visible

**Colour Scheme**

- The colour scheme of dark slate gray, black and white was used as when checking on the colour contrast ratio they passed all tests

![colour contrast image](assets/images/colour-contrast.PNG)

### Issues and Bugs

- Initally when creating the webiste I had an issue that the website was always slightly too big for the screen, my first thought was that there was an element that was pushing out of its parent element
  - The issue was that I was missing a max-width on the body parent element, to solve this issue I had to add a max-width to the correct element and this fixed the issue
- Another issue I faced was concerning the embedded video and podcast, when I added these into my code they came with some pre-set dimensions and also caused an issue with the validation
  - To solve this issue I removed the CSS which came with the video and podcast and added my own CSS to re-style both elements, I also followed the recommendations of the validator
- When validating my code I found there was an issue with the mobile navigation bar, the error related to the value given to the "for" attribute and the value given the the "name" attribute did not match. When correcting this initially it broke the styling that was applied to the checkbox.
  - To solve this issue I had to go through the mobile navigation code as well as the developer tools to understand what classes were being added and what classes were not being added. From this, I could understand what the issue was and how to fix it which was to update the class name.

### Performance

- When testing the website on Pagespeed I found there was a reduction in performance, to resolve this I updated all images to webp
- The reason for this is that there is a signification reduction in the size of the image without a loss of quality which results in a faster website loading time
- Other benefits include reduced bandwidth

### SEO

- To improve the SEO side of the webiste i have included the follow code below.
  - I have added a meta section which includes certain keywords, meaning that when a user searches these words there is a higher chance that my site will appear in the search results
  - There is also a title included which will be picked up by Google when a search is completed

```
<!-- title and tab icon -->

    <link
      rel="icon"
      type="images/x-icon"
      href="assets/images/commando-insignia.jpg" />

    <title>St Nazaire Raid</title>

    <!-- Meta tags for search engines -->

    <meta
      name="description"
      content="WW2, France, British, Germans, st nazaire, royal navy"  />
    <meta name="keywords" content="WW2, raid, British, Commando, Raid" />
```

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
