## About the project

![picture of the mockup of the website](assets/images/mockup.PNG)

I have created a website where a user can view infomration about the St Nazaire Raid which is a battle that took place during WW2 but is not so well known or famous as some other battles such as D-day or the battle of berlin. But i'd i argue should equally be placed up there and what was done on that fatful day was something that people have said was considered to be not possible and a sucide mission.

Through the website I aim to show a yuser how the plan initally got it routes and the reasons such a plan had to come together, and then it will be explained to them both the battle itelf and the stuggles and problems that was faced by the attacking force, before finally finishing by showing where a person can visit the war memorial for this battle.

There are also links to further docuemnts and videos where a user can find further information and even some first hand accounts of the men who took part in the battle.

### Typography and color scheme

- For the font i have used Playpen Sans [google font link](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans)
  - i have used this font as i was looking for a style that would appear to be hand wriotten
  - i have also used this font as the main background of the site contains an image from a declassifed doucemnt about the raid, i was looking for a font style that match this style of text
  - i also wanted the text to almost look as if it was from that time period
- for the colours i have kept this to simple colours of dark slate grey, black and white
  - these colours ahv been choosen due to the time period the website cover 1939-1945
  - during this period most images were black and white
  - also i wanted the colour scheme to follow the background which is taken from a declassifed document

### WIREFRAMES

#### HOME PAGE

- the idea of the the homepage was to create something that had a large clear image at the top and within the few seconds the user should clearly be able to tell what the website is about
- the homepage was also to contain the content of the battle and break it down into a number of sections either 4 or 5
- each section was to have both image and text to balance out the page

![homepage wireframe](assets/images/homepage-wireframe.PNG)

#### GALLERY PAGE

- this page was to be made up of 2 parts a gallery section and vc winners section
- the gallery section is to include all real images either from before or after the battle and aswell as images related to the battle
- the images would be responsive in desgin
- below or about that there would be a vc winners section, this would describe the person and provide comments about them

![Gallery wireframe](assets/images/gallery-wireframe.PNG)

#### media PAGE

- this page included some more visual content as well as some offical videos and interviews
- the page is to comtain some embed content from other site to give people a more broad expericne
- the layout would be set to one or two videos coupled with some book recommendations
- the book recommendation section would also provide a link so the user can go onto purchase the book if they so wish

![Media Page wireframe](assets/images/media-page-wireframe.PNG)

## Testing

- i have tested the website in different broswers such as google, firefox and edge
- on each browser i have gone into the dev tools and tested the websiet at different screen sizes
- I have used lighthouse to test the website as per the image below:

![iamge showing page speed report pc result](assets/images/pagespeed-report-pc.PNG)

### Validator Testing

- I have tested all HTML pages on the HTML validator and there are no errors

  - home page
  - gallery page
  - media page

- when building the website have used an extension called pritter which has resulted in the warning that you can see on each screenshot

  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)

  ![html validator results](assets/images/html-validator.PNG)

- When testing my CSS as you can see from the below image tehre were no errors

  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)

![CSS validator results](assets/images/css-validator.PNG)

- when testing the website on different devices i have used the pre-defined dimensions that come with the developer tool on google chrome
- i have also reasearch a number of website which have described the most connon screen size for devices in 2023 for desktop and mobile - https://www.designrush.com/agency/web-development-companies/trends/website-dimensions

![Media Page wireframe](assets/images/most-common-screen-resolutions-worldwide-content.jpg)

**external links**

- i have tested each external link to make sure that it goes to the correct website
- I have also tested the links to make sure that they all open the website on a new broswer tab

**mobile navbar header**

- the navbar on mobile has been tested to make sure that it appears when the burger is clicked
- the navbar has been test to make sure that the large screen navbar disappers and only the mobile version is visible

**Colour Scheme**

- the colour scheme of dark slate gray, black and white was also used as when checking on the colour contrast ratio they passed all tests

![colour contrast image](assets/images/colour-contrast.PNG)

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

The live link can be found here - https://gmontaque.github.io/project1-st-nazaire-raid/index.html

### Issues and Bugs

- inital when creating the webiste i had an issue that the website was always slightling to big for the screen, my first thought was that there was an element that was pushing out of its parent element
  - the issue was that i was missing a max-width on the body parent element, once this was added the issue was fixed
- another issue i faced was with regards to the embeded video and podcast, when i added these into my code they came with some pre-set dimensions and also caused an issue with the validation
  - to solve this issue i removed the css which came with the video and podcast and added in my own css to re-style both elements, i also followed the recommendations of the validator
