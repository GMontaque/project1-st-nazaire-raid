          <h2 class="st-nazaire-main-content-header">Background</h2>
          <p class="st-nazaire-main-content-text">
            Operation Chariot was an audacious Combined Operation raid on the
            port of St Nazaire in German occupied France. Packed with tons of
            high explosives, the destroyer, HMS Campbeltown, was rammed into the
            gates of the only dry dock capable of servicing the German
            battleship Tirpitz. Such was the damage, the dry dock was rendered
            unusable for the remainder of the war. In the second week of January
            1942, the powerful German battleship, Tirpitz, moved from the
            Baltic, through the Kiel canal and north to Trondheim on the
            Norwegian coast. From there, it had the potential to break out into
            the North Atlantic and to wreak havoc on allied Atlantic convoys. C
            in C Home Fleet, Admiral Tovey, opined that to sink the Tirpitz
            would be "of incomparably greater importance to the conduct of the
            war than the safety of any convoy." Churchill shared this view,
            commenting that "the entire naval situation throughout the world
            would be altered." Four separate attempts to bomb the Tirpitz
            failed, with the loss of 12 aircraft. A different strategy was
            required. The Germans needed dry-dock facilities on the Atlantic
            coast, before the battleship could be deployed effectively against
            allied convoys and the only suitable port was St. Nazaire. It lay on
            the north bank of the River Loire about 6 miles from the river
            mouth, which itself was about 6 miles wide. The Planning Division in
            the Admiralty, conceived the idea to destroy the lock gate at St
            Nazaire which would render the dry dock unusable. The idea was
            picked up by Captain Charles Lambe (who became First Sea Lord from
            1959 to 1960). He took the idea to Mountbatten, head of Combined
            Operations - the first outside client for COHQ. The target area was
            bordered by the River Loire, the waters of the outer harbour and the
            Basin of St Nazaire - a total area of less than one square mile. The
            heavy concentration of enemy defensive positions and troops in the
            area strongly reflected the importance of the port facilities to
            them. It was, arguably, the most heavily defended place along the
            whole of the German occupied Atlantic coast. In this confined space
            there were power stations, pumping stations, warehouses, lock
            installations and the old town of St Nazaire. Denying the Germans
            use of the dry dock would effectively neutralize the threat the
            Tirpitz posed.

          <h2 class="st-nazaire-main-content-header">The Plan</h2>
          <div>
            <p class="st-nazaire-main-content-text">
              The estuary was a complex mixture of mud flats and channels. A
              frontal assault would, therefore, need a shallow draught vessel
              running on a high tide. Although heavily defended, the Germans
              were unlikely to have considered an attack across the mud flats
              and shoals. Meticulous planning followed and advice sought on the
              vagaries of tides and winds, which included studying French
              nautical charts and tables up to 100 years old! The outline plan
              was simple. The selected vessel, packed with high explosives in
              the bow with troops and crew in protected areas, would ram the
              outer lock gate at speed and become firmly stuck there. They would
              then disembark and take cover behind a nearby air-raid shelter.
              The ship would then blow up destroying the gate. A Motor Torpedo
              Boat would then approach to fire especially designed torpedoes at
              the inner gate which would collapse under pressure when the tide
              went out, damaging the submarines berthed in their protected pens.
              The troops and crew would then destroy as many dockyard targets as
              they could and withdraw in fast motor launches which had followed
              them in. All this was to be achieved under cover of an air raid.
              The planners, themselves, had reservations about the withdrawal
              phase which was difficult to predict since much depended on the
              element of surprise and the effectiveness of the opposing forces.
              However, the risks were less than the potential rewards. Outside
              the planning circle, the Naval C in C Plymouth, thought the vessel
              would bounce off the gate, a view he maintained against the advice
              of the engineer who built it. He also thought that anyone within
              half a mile of the explosion would be killed. Mountbatten conceded
              the point about the destructive power of the explosion and delayed
              action fuses were to be fitted to allow time for the troops and
              crew to evacuate the area. However, on the question of the use of
              a boat to ram the lock gate, he held firm. It was also decided to
              spread the raiding force between the main ship and the supporting
              motor launches, simply to avoid the total loss of the force in the
              event of disaster befalling the main ship. HMS Campbeltown, an
              American lend-lease destroyer (USS Buchanan), was chosen to lead
              the operation. Her interior was stripped out, the bridge was
              armour-plated and additional protection provided for the Commandos
              she would carry. The accompanying motor launches (MLs), were to
              carry 150 Commandos. The boats were fitted with two Oerlikon 20mm
              guns and additional fuel tanks to increase their range. As the
              needs of the raid were reassessed, the ML fleet was increased to
              10 and then to 14. Only one motor gun boat (MGB) was available -
              MGB 314, a C-Class Fairmile, commanded by Lt. Dunstan Curtis. She
              would lead the attack with motor torpedo boat (MTB) 74 in reserve.
              This was equipped with unproven flying torpedoes to breach the dry
              dock gates if the Campbeltown failed to reach its target.

          <p class="st-nazaire-main-content-text">
            The fleet sailed from Falmouth at 3 pm on the 26th of March. MGB
            314, was at the head with two escort destroyers flanking the MLs and
            HMS Campbeltown. South west of Ushant, they came across a U-Boat and
            damaged it. They departed the area on a false course which the
            submarine duly reported to their command and control HQ. Five German
            torpedo boats left St Nazaire to engage the vessels but in entirely
            the wrong direction. They were still at sea during the raid. Around
            midnight on the 27/28th March, the raiders saw bomb flashes and
            tracers light the sky. The diversionary bombing air raid had started
            but it lacked accuracy due to low cloud causing an alert in the town
            and its approaches, rather than the intended effect of keeping the
            German forces in their bunkers. The bombers had been briefed to
            target only specific military installations to avoid civilian
            casualties. Those who failed to identify their targets, did not drop
            their bombs. Each boat flew the German flag to confuse the enemy and
            delay identification. Submarine, HMS Sturgeon, provided the exact
            position for entry to the estuary from which the raiding force was
            to make its run up the estuary. The Campbeltown crept through at 5
            knots, touching bottom twice. At 0120 hours, search lights
            illuminated the entire fleet but, for a short time, the Germans were
            reluctant to open fire possibly because of confusion caused by spoof
            signals and a general disbelief that such an audacious raid could be
            undertaken. The German flags were then replaced with White Ensigns
            when the fleet was still two miles from its target. The Germans
            responded with intense shelling and gun fire during the final 15
            minutes of the run in, during which half the men aboard the MLs were
            either killed or wounded. The Campbeltown cleared the estuary and
            increased speed to break through the torpedo barrier and into the
            dock gate. The MLs were all but stopped, only two succeeded in
            landing their full complement of Commandos. Other MLs approached the
            landing zones, but were forced to re-embark their Commandos in the
            face of very heavy fire from 20mm cannons. On shore fighting was
            ferocious and close quartered. At 0134 hours, Campbeltown was
            successfully driven at speed into the dock gates just 4 minutes
            behind schedule. Most of her crew were taken aboard MGB 314 while
            MTB 74 deployed her delayed action torpedoes in the foundations of
            the old entrance dock gate. Captain Ryder, CO of the Naval forces,
            went ashore and satisfied himself that Campbeltown was both scuttled
            and embedded in the loch gate. At 0230 hours, Ryder decided to
            withdraw. By this time, more than half of his craft had been
            destroyed and the remainder were riddled.... if he didn't withdraw
            soon, he would lose them all. MTB 74, departed the area of action to
            rendezvous with British destroyers in the open sea off the Loire.
            She carried 26 men on board and was accompanied by 7 other craft.
            She stopped to pick up two more survivors, but was hit by accurate
            shelling from shore batteries. Only 3 of the 34 aboard survived. The
            remaining craft met the 5 German torpedo boats returning from their
            fruitless mission. In further enemy fire, more craft were destroyed
            or scuttled and their crews transferred to the remaining craft. Of
            the 18 coastal craft, which set out from Falmouth, only four
            returned.

            The Normandie Dock months after the raid. The wreck of HMS
            Campbeltown is dwarfed by the size of the dock The explosion put the
            dry dock out of commission until the end of the war. The St Nazaire
            raid had been a success, but at a cost. Of the 622 men of the Royal
            Navy and Commandos who took part in the raid, only 228 men returned
            to England. Five escaped overland via Spain and Gibraltar. 169 men
            were killed (105 RN and 64 Commandos) and another 215 became
            prisoners of war (106 RN and 109 Commandos). They were first taken
            to La Baule and then sent to Stalag 133 at Rennes. The fallen
            British raiders were buried at the Escoublac-la-Baule cemetery with
            military honors. The cemetery is located 13 kilometres west of St
            Nazaire. To recognise their achievement, 89 decorations were awarded
            for the raid. This total includes the five Victoria Crosses awarded
            to Lieutenant Commander Beattie, Lieutenant Colonel Newman and
            Commander Ryder, and posthumous awards to Sergeant Durrant and Able
            Seaman Savage. Other decorations awarded were four Distinguished
            Service Orders, four Conspicuous Gallantry Medals, five
            Distinguished Conduct Medals, 17 Distinguished Service Crosses, 11
            Military Crosses, 24 Distinguished Service Medals and 15 Military
            Medals. Four men were awarded the Croix de Guerre by France, another
            51 were mentioned in dispatches. Adolf Hitler was furious that the
            British had been able to sail a flotilla of ships up the Loire
            unhindered. His immediate reaction was to dismiss Generaloberst Carl
            Hilpert, chief-of-staff to the Commander in Chief West. The raid
            refocused German attention on the Atlantic Wall, and special
            attention was given to ports to prevent any repeat of the raid. By
            June 1942 the Germans began using concrete to fortify gun
            emplacements and bunkers in quantities previously only used in
            U-boat pens. Hitler laid out new plans in a meeting with Armaments
            Minister Albert Speer in August 1942, calling for the construction
            of 15,000 bunkers by May 1943 to defend the Atlantic coast from
            Norway to Spain. The battleship Tirpitz never entered the Atlantic.
            She remained in Norwegian fjords to threaten Allied shipping until
            she was destroyed by the RAF on 12 November 1944. St Nazaire was one
            of the 38 battle honours presented to the Commandos after the war.
            The raid has since been called The Greatest Raid of All. The
            survivors formed their own association, the St Nazaire Society,
            which is a registered charity in the United Kingdom.
